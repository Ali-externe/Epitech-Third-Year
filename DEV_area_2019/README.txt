The goal of this project is to discover, as a whole, the software platform that you have chosen through the creation of a business application.
To do this, we must implement a software suite.

This software suite will be broken into three parts :
• An application server to implement all the features listed below
• A web client to use the application from your browser by querying the application server
• A mobile client to use the application from your phone by querying the application server



How to start the project:   - Go in the root ./DEV_area_2019
                            - Use this command: "sudo docker-compose up --build"
                            - On the browser web, write and go on "localhost:8081"

The web and mobile parts are connected to the restapi server which run on localhost:8080

You can create a user and connect to the home page, where many services are presented and you can interact with:

- Trello
- Gmail
- Weather
- Intra Epitech
