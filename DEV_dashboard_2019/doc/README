This is the Dashboard Epitech Project of Ali and Thomas

This little readme file while allow you to understand how to use it.

When launching the website you will be presented with two options :
    - Log in with an already created Login and Password
    - Register to the site, create a Login and Password, in this "register" page you will find a "Sign Up with Google" buttton that you can use if you want.

Once in the app feel free to tick any services you want to see displayed on your dashboard.
Then press the bottom button "Display" that will allow you to get what you ask for.

The different services available are :
    - Meteo
    - Stock Exchange
    - T-Rex game
    - Restaurant finder
    - Football results
    - Reddit feed
    - A calculator

You are free to tick as much a you want or may need.

On the left side of the screen you will find a black menu where you are able to either refresh the current page or log out of Dashboard.

As a bonus just under the "Display" button you will find a "Share on Facebook" button that will allow you to share Dashboard on your Facebook feed (you need to login Facebook first).


For this project we used several different technologies such as Node js, HTML, Css, Mongodb and Docker.
