To do so you need to execute the program,to load the library you want, and to write your User Name, by default it will be "player".

What is better than an exemple ? :)

to execute the game pacman with the SFML lib and with the nickname "Shizzuth" you will have to do this :

	./arcade ./lib_arcade_sfml.so Shizzuth

- 1 - exec prog
- 2 - load lib
- 3 - nickname
